# Domain Context

## Curated Trend

An admin-owned reusable generation template stored as an `AdminTrend`. Ordinary users can run a Curated Trend but cannot edit its hidden generation recipe.

## Template Category

An admin-owned grouping of Curated Trends shown to users as a category of ready-made templates. Ordinary users cannot create, rename, hide, reorder, or delete Template Categories.

The mandatory `Тренды` category is the live/root category. A Curated Trend with no explicit category assignment appears there.

## Trend Assignment

The relationship that places one Curated Trend into one Template Category.

A Trend Assignment can be:

- **manual** — an admin explicitly chose the category; later hashtag edits must not override it;
- **automatic** — the category was selected from the trend's hashtags and may be recalculated when those tags or categories change.

A manual assignment to the root `Тренды` category is still an explicit assignment and remains authoritative.
